If you saved the entire model:
If you saved the entire model (including the architecture), you can load it directly like this:

python
Copy code
model = torch.load('entire_model-3.pth')
model.eval()


Model Definition: You need to define the model class (ResNet56 and BottleNeckResidualBlock) the same way as when you trained the model.
load_state_dict: This loads the trained weights into the model.
model.eval(): This is important because it sets the model in evaluation mode, which disables features like dropout or batch normalization that behave differently during training.
# Instantiate the model
model = ResNet56(input_features=3, hidden_units=64, output_classes=10)

# Load the saved model weights (make sure the file path is correct)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))  #
